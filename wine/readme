Add the following rule to the udev subsystem:
open terminal and as root type:
#echo 'SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="e11c", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0666"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/51-minipro.rules
#udevadm trigger


How to install:
1. Install wine
2. Rename the provided setupapi_vxxx.dll file to setupapi.dll and copy this file in the minipro folder
3. Run the Minipro.exe

The setupapi_v610.dll is for minipro V6.0/V6.10,

2. Run make
3. Rename usb.dll.so as setupapi.dll and copy this file in the minipro folder
